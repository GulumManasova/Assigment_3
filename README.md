# Personal Account Management

This is a simple Python project that helps manage a personal bank account. It allows you to
**deposit money, withdraw money, check your balance, and view your transaction history**.  



##  How It Works  

 

1. **amount.py** – Defines the `Amount` class to represent transactions.  
2. **personal_account.py** – Defines the `PersonalAccount` class to manage the account.
